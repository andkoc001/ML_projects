## Statistical analysis of flipping a coin.

The exercise is a part of the Machine Learning and Statistics module at Galway-Mayo Institut of Technology.

The original coin-flip.ipynb Jupyter Notebook has been taken from <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ianmcloughlin/jupyter-teaching-notebooks/blob/master/coin-flip.ipynb>.

Next, I am going to play with the notebook and learn something about the features contained in it. I am also going to explore other options this coin-flipping concept has to offer.
