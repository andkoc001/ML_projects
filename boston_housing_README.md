## 1. Introduction

This repository documents my research, project progress (including comments for my future reference) and findings of the `Boston Housing` data set analysis.

The detailed Project instructions:
<https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/project-2019-machstat/raw/master/project.pdf>  

The data set analysis is conducted within Jupyter Notebook `boston_housing_dataset_analysis.ipynb` located in this GitHub repository: <https://github.com/andkoc001/ML_projects>.

## 2. The data set

The Boston Housing data set is avialable from Scikit-learn data set library. The data from this source has been used in the project.

For reference, the data set as a csv file from <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/> was added to the ropository.
