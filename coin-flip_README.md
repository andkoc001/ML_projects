## Statistical analysis of flipping a coin.

The exercise is a based on a notebook by  Ian McLoughlin, available at <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ianmcloughlin/jupyter-teaching-notebooks/blob/master/coin-flip.ipynb>.

The Jupyter Notebook is located on my GitHub repository, link: [coin-flip.ipynb](https://github.com/andkoc001/ML_projects/).

The intention behind this exercise is to familiarise myself with
* Jupyter Notebook,
* Seaborn package, and
* the statistical methods in general.
